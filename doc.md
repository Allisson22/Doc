This document explains the format you must follow to prepare a zip folder containing the icons required by the application. Please follow these instructions to ensure that your icons are correctly formatted and functional.

## Zip folder structure

The zip folder must follow this structure :

```/icons woman.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) man.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) unknown.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) child.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) adult.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) old.png (or .jpg, .jpeg)```

## File names

- woman: Represents a woman.
- man: Represents a man.
- unknown: Represents a person of unknown gender.
- child: Represents a child.
- adult: Represents an adult.
- old: Represents an elderly person.

## Image format

- Accepted formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square format).  
If images do not meet this ratio, they will be resized, which might lead to stretching.

2. Compress the folder into a zip file.
3. Share the zip file via a URL.
