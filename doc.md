# Documentation for icon zip folder format

This document explains the format you must follow to prepare a zip folder containing the icons required by the application. Please follow these instructions to ensure that your icons are correctly formatted and functional.

## Zip folder structure

The zip folder must follow this structure:

```
/icons 
    woman.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) 
    man.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) 
    unknown.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) 
    child.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) 
    adult.png (or .jpg, .jpeg) 
    old.png (or .jpg, .jpeg)
```

## File names

Images must be named and organized as follows:

- woman: An image representing a woman.
- man: An image representing a man.
- unknown: An image representing a person of unknown gender.
- child: An image representing a child.
- adult: An image representing an adult.
- old: An image representing an elderly person.

## Image format

- Accepted formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square format). If images do not meet this ratio, they will be resized, which might lead to stretching.

### Final steps

1. Verify all files meet the requirements.
2. Compress the folder into a zip file.
3. Share the zip file via a URL.
